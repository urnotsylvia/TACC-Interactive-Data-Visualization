# Abstract

Housing issues based on racial disparities and income inequality continue to rise in Boston. In particular, The American City Coalition (TACC) has identified Dorchester, Roxbury, Downtown Boston, and South Boston Waterfront as areas of interest. TACC is a non-profit innovative consultancy organization based in the Boston neighborhood of Roxbury, grounded in an inclusive, comprehensive, and collaborative approach to neighborhood revitalization.

Our mission was to display Boston housing data relating to racial demographics, income distribution, and housing type. These graphs are intended to provide TACC and their partners with an overview of Dorchester, Roxbury, South Boston Waterfront, and Downtown Boston. We hope these graphs are found to be a concise display of the given, aggregated data. These visualizations are expected to be used for internal distribution and communication within TACC and between TACC and relevant partners.
